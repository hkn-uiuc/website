Info Sessions and Tech Talks
---
HKN hosts a number of information sessions and tech talks that are sponsored by companies. These sessions are conducted on campus and give students a chance to learn more about the employer, recent technological advances, or career opportunities. The students have the opportunity to interact with recruiters, ask questions, and express their interest in available opportunities.
In addition, we help companies advertise career opportunities and campus events to our students through fliers, email newsletters, building monitors, etc.

Technical workshops teach students about current software, hardware, engineering and business concepts to be competitive in todayâ€™s market. Typically these are focused on a particular skill or using a specific tool. Companies can sponsor, and teach, these technical workshops to gear them towards any skills or products they would like to showcase.
Additionally, HKN will help companies host on-campus hackathons by providing advertisements, staffing, etc.
