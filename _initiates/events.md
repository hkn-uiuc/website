IEEE/HKN Happy Hours
---
By far the easiest way to get Social Points for initiation is by attending the weekly HKN Happy Hours, at Legends Bar & Grill on Green Street almost every Friday, from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Come meet your officers, fellow initiates, and HKN Members while eating a free appetizer for every drink you buy! 1 Social Point is awarded for initiate attendance.

Smash Mondays
---
The second easiest way to get Social Points for initiation is by coming to Smash Mondays! Pass by ECEB 2013 on Mondays at 5PM for some video games, free pizza, and 1 Social Point. Spring 2019 Smash Mondays have started!
