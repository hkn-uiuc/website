Soon, former initiates might come up looking for their membership certificates during your office hours. Don’t panic. The file-folio that contains them is located in the bottom right-hand drawer of the office hours desk, and is organized by the semester that the initiation occurred. You can locate the specific certificate being requested by name and initiation semester.
