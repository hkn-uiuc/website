Review sessions:
---
Check out the calendar for courses that we are offering review sessions that we are offering in Fall 2020.

Archived review sessions can be found at the bottom of this page.

We also assist course staff in their review sessions if they need help from HKN. This is also a great chance for our members to get involved and to practice presentation skills in an academic context.

HKN offers free one-on-one peer tutoring. Simply contact a tutor to arrange a time. The tutorâ€™s netid, and the courses for which they are offering tutoring are listed below. If you would like a tutor for a course that is not listed below, please reach out to Alan Liu at afl2@illinois.edu, and we will be happy to arrange something. You can also check the [CARE website](http://publish.illinois.edu/engineering-care/) for tutoring and extra office hours in non-ECE required classes.

Technical Interviews:
---
HKN offers mock technical interviews targeted for students interviewing with ECE companies (software and hardware). Interviews are available either in an interview room with a whiteboard, or over the phone. You will be given questions that accurately reflect the questions given by the company you will be interviewing with, and, where possible, your interviewer will have received an offer from the company as well.
