If you would like a tutor for a course that is not listed below, please reach out to Keshav Harisrikanth at keshavh2@illinois.edu, and we will be happy to arrange something.

Technical Interviews:
---
HKN offers mock technical interviews targeted for students interviewing with ECE companies (software and hardware). Interviews are available either in an interview room with a whiteboard, or over the phone. You will be given questions that accurately reflect the questions given by the company you will be interviewing with, and, where possible, your interviewer will have received an offer from the company as well.
