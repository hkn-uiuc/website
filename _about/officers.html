    <td><br/><br/><br/>I am a senior in Electrical Engineering with a majority focus on Semiconductors and Nanotechnology. I am Undergraduate Research Assistant in the Zhu 2-D Material Research Group, which I have found to be a great way to explore my passions further. I am a TA for ECE 443, which is a great class that I would recommend to anyone who is interested in microelectronic devices and I am a CARE tutor. I enjoy helping others not only through tutoring, but also through acts of kindness and service, which lead me to Co-found the Shanghai Run for Refugees in 2016. In my free time, I enjoy being on the university’s rugby team, playing video games, and making my own music. One day I’ll go pro in one of those things. But, for now I am the Director of Initiate Affairs for HKN.<br/><br/><br/></td>
