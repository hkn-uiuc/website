Membership in HKN is extended to the top fifth of the upper sophomore class (45-59 credit hours), top quarter of the junior class (60-90 credit hours), the top third of the senior class (90+ credit hours), and all graduate students. Undergraduate students will need to have taken at least 3 ECE courses. Students who meet these requirements will be invited to join HKN at the beginning of the semester. Once invited, initiates will perform a semester of service for HKN before initiating at the end of the semester. See the Initiates Page for more information.
